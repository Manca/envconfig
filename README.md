Bash Environment Setup
============
Clone and run this on a new machine to configure your `bash`,  `emacs` and `tmux` development environment as follows:

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/Manca/envconfig.git
./envconfig/setup.sh
```

It supports installing the pre-requisites as well, but that needs updating (TODO).
